Announcements:
- The [course calendar]({{ "/calendar" | relative_url }}) has been updated with some discussion timing changes:
    - Catherine's Tue 6-7pm section is cancelled (it overlaps lecture and we found that it has low attendance).
    - Catherine added an extended-time section Wed 5-7pm (Wheeler 224), and a regular section Tue 10-11am (Soda 405).
    - Rishi's Tue 4-5pm section (which overlapped with another section) has been moved to Wed 9-10am (Hildebrand B56).
    - Rudy's Thu 9am section is cancelled (we've reallocated hours to better OH support).
- The [policies page]({{ "/policies" | relative_url }}) has been updated with details about extra credit opportunities.
    - You'll receive 0.1% extra credit for each section you attend, up to a maximum of 1% for attending 10 sections. You'll be able to track your attendance on Gradescope.
    - You'll receive up to 1% of extra credit for contributions on Ed (e.g. answering other students' questions). We won't disclose how much extra credit you receive, but we'll account for it in grade calculations at the end of the semester.
- We've released an [extensions form]({{ site.aux_links["Extensions Form"] }}) that you can submit if you need extra time on assignments.
