    - If none of the times work, please reach out.
- [#616](https://edstem.org/us/courses/32976/discussion/threads/616) In light of lecture not getting to particle filtering today, we are extending the Project 5 deadline to **Thursday, April 6th** 11:59 PM PT.
    - That being said, only questions 9-11 rely on that, so be sure to keep up with the rest of the project. You are not expected to work over break, though.
