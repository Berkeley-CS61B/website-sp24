# Project 0: 2048 - FAQ

Course staff will continuously add to this page as you all ask questions about the project! If you have a question that
isn't answered here, ask in lab, OH, or on Ed!

## Setup

### In IntelliJ, I get "release version 18 not supported"

Go into File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project, and make sure that your Language level is set to 17.
Additionally, head over to Modules and make sure that the `proj0` Language level is 17.

## Getting Started

### This seems like a lot of code to write. How do we check along the way if we're doing it correctly?

This is called testing! There are 2 main ways we can test our code: unit testing and acceptance / integration testing.
Unit testing aims to test the individual pieces of code of your programâ€”generally, individual methods. Acceptance /
integration testing tests how your program as a whole works, including how classes interface with each other and how
user input is handled.

Here's the [section about testing in the spec](index.md#testing). For this project, we have provided you all the tests
we'll use to grade the assignment. You'll run these tests via JUnit. You can run each of the test classes in IntelliJ,
and it will show you which tests pass or fail, including expected values vs. your actual output. This is very, very
useful for debugging. A general workflow would be to take a look at the tests you're failing, understand the expected
values, compare them with your actual output, and use the debugger to walk through the test case if you're stuck. You
can even write your own tests, following the format of the provided ones! This is good practice as we'll expect you to
do this in later assignments (and you'll have to write your own tests in the real world). Lab 4, on Monday, will dive
deeper into this, so don't worry if not all this makes sense just yet. You'll get plenty of practice with it starting
with this project though!

## `TestAtLeastOneMoveExists`

### I pass everything in `TestAtLeastOneMoveExists` except for `testAnyDir`. If my code works for each direction, why would it break for any direction?

In this test, the relevant moves are on the border (specifically, the upper-right corner). If you are looping over the
coordinates in the board, make sure that you are considering _every possible comparison_. For example, your boundary
condition in the for loop may be off by one.

## `tilt`

### I don't know how to get started on `tilt`.

First, watch [Josh's intro video to this method](https://youtu.be/abFbbK1QY2k)!

`tilt` is, at its core, doing the same couple of small things several times over. This is a _really good place_ to try
to use helper methods! Check out the
[Tips](index.md#tips) section of the spec for suggestions on what these helper methods could do.

### For `tilt`, my code works in the up direction, but doesn't in any of the other directions.

There are two possibilities here:

1. Make sure that you're setting the viewing perspective, and _resetting_ it back to north after you're done.
1. **Make sure that you don't use `Tile::row` or `Tile::col`.** The `Tile`
   class doesn't know anything about the `Board`'s `viewPerspective`!

### Am I allowed to modify `Tile`? I want to store whether a tile has been merged or not, to prevent multiple merges.

Unfortunately, any modifications you make to other files will not make it to the autograder. This includes modifications
to `Tile.java`.

Rather than storing this information as an instance variable of the tile, consider the following question. Let's assume
that we're handling `tilt` column by column. If we process a tile that merges and ends on row R, then what is the
highest row that any lower tile could end on?
