Hi! Iâ€™m Vika and Iâ€™m a third year Computer Science and Data Science major. Some of my interests include hiking, ballet, and skiing! When Iâ€™m not debugging something you can find me going on walks around Berkeley or the Fire Trails. There are so many good restaurants in Berkeley but if I had to pick one I'd say it's Lucia's (the pizza there is ðŸ¤Œ). A fun fact about me is that I absolutely love carrots and always have at least 3 carrot related items on me. Can't wait to help teach some data structures :)
