Hey! I'm a third year CS major from Hong Kong. I am a huge foodie and love trying new cuisines and baking in my free time. My other hobbies include playing smash, reading, and taking care of my 6 cats and 1 dog when I'm back home. Looking forward to meeting you all and reach out to me anytime for anything (especially if you want pet pics :D)
