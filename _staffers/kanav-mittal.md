Hi! My name is Kanav, and I'm a third-year EECS major. My interests lie in machine learning, software engineering, and computational biology. In my free time, you can find me working out at the gym, hiking the Fire Trails, or watching sitcoms. I'm also a massive Taylor Swift fan :). Looking forward to meeting you!
