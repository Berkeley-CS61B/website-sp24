Hey guys! I'm Sophie, I'm a junior studying BioE and CS. This is my fourth semester on staff, but my first time as a TA :) I like watching sports, hiking and screaming at my screen playing video games. Im really excited to be teaching my favorite CS course, I love questions that tickle my brain so feel free to reach out to me about every and anything!
