Hi everyone! Iâ€™m a junior studying CS with a DS minor. I took 61B in Spring 2023 and am now on course staff for the first time and am super excited to be teaching you all! I came into Berkeley as ChemE and changed my major 7+ times LOL! In my free time, I love exploring new food spots, working at cafes, playing volleyball, and vlogging!
