Hii, Iâ€™m Ayati! I'm a junior from India studying CS and Linguistics. This has been my favourite class so far and I'm super excited to be teaching 61B again! I really enjoy reading, music and learning about art history and the brain. Currently trying to explore San Francisco more! Feel free to reach out anytime and looking forward to meeting everyone :D
