Hi hi~~ I'm Ryssa, and I'm a junior majoring in data science. I've been an AI for 61B for 2 semesters, but this is my first semester as a tutor! In my free time, I enjoy crocheting, binge-watching video game play-throughs/anime, listening to j-pop/k-pop/r&b, impulse purchasing silly treats, and playing the violin with the Intermission Orchestra on campus! Feel free to reach out to me about anything :D âœ¨
