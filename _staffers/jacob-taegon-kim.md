Hi, I'm Jacob! I'm a third-year majoring in CS and DS. In my free time, I enjoy running, reading cookbooks, and drinking lots of coffee. Before I came to Berkeley, I was a barista and a baker, so I have many fun and unique experiences that I can share! Feel free to reach out to me for anything. My goal is to support you as best as I can :)
