Hey y'all! I'm Josh, a 3rd year from Austin majoring in CS. When I'm not writing bugs, I love to play indoor and outdoor volleyball, dominate my housemates in mario kart, watch anime (open to recs), and show people photos of my 2 dogs. I'm super excited to meet everyone this semester!  Don't hesitate to reach out if I can help in any way :)
