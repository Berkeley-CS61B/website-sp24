Hello, I'm a second-year lecturer in EECS (so don't call me Professor please). I did my undergrad at Berkeley, where I TA'd for a few classes (including CS 61C, CS 161, and CS 188 once). Then I did a masters' at Berkeley, where I studied computer science education with Nicholas Weaver and Dan Garcia. This is my second time teaching CS 61B as co-instructor, so any feedback/advice/complaints are appreciated!
