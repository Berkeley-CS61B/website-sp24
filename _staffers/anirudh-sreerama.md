Hello everyone! I'm Anirudh, a sophomore majoring in Math and CS from the Bay. In my free time, I LOVE playing video games like Smash (Kirby is the best) and Overcooked with friends, especially when we're working together as a team! I also really enjoy speed-solving Sudokus and KenKens whenever I'm bored. This is my first semester as a TA, so I'm super duper excited to work with you all :)
