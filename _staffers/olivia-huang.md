Weeeee hi I'm Olivia and I'm a senior (sob) majoring in CS and cogsci from NJ! I'm a big kpoppie, and I enjoy playing the piano, watching kdramas, playing cozy games, and I also just started crocheting. If you ever run into me in the wild, 9 times out of 10 I will have a boba or matcha in hand. This is my third semester on staff and I'm excited for a great semester! Feel free to reach out to chat about anything :)
