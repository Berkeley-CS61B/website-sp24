Hey y'all! My name is Dom, I'm a CS major from the Salinas Valley and this is my 5th semester TAing for the 61Best course. I like trying new things, and in my time here I've done everything from latin dance to rocket engineering to collegiate boxing. Maybe you'll see me around trying way too hard in IM volleyball or on my mission to find the best Berkeley restaurants  :)
