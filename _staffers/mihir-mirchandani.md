Hi 61Besties! I'm Mihir, a 3rd year studying CS from Mountain View, CA. I'm super happy to be back for my second semester on course staff for this amazing and foundational course! In my free time, I love playing chess, piano, and going on long drives. I look forward to working with you and a fun semester!
