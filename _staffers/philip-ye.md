Hey y'all! I'm Philip, a 2nd year studying CS + Math and native Floridian. One time I fell into a mannequin display in Spain but I try not to think about it. My hobbies include daydreaming about being the best at a hobby I just picked up and watching horror movie recaps in YouTube so I can hide in the comments section. Look forward to meeting everyone!
