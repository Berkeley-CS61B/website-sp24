Hello! I'm a 4th year CS major from the central valley. This is my 5th semester on 61B staff and I have a feeling it's going to be the best yet. I'm a big football fan and am always happy to talk. Also, if any of the course infrastructure breaks... sorry. Hope to see you in OH, lab, and discussion!
