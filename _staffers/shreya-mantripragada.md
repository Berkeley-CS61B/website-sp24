Hi! My name is Shreya and I'm a second year double majoring in CS & DS! I really enjoyed CS 61B when I took the class and I'm excited to AI this semester. In my free time, I really enjoy hiking, journaling, and finding cozy new study spots on campus (my favorite are Morrison Library and Yallis). Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
