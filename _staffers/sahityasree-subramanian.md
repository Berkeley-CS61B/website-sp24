Hi! My name is Sree, and I'm a junior majoring in CS. This is my 2nd time teaching 61B, and it's one of my favorite classes at Berkeley - I hope you enjoy it as much as I did :) In my free time, I love writing, hiking, and watching movies, and I've recently been learning to crochet. Feel free to reach out anytime, and I'm excited to meet you all!
