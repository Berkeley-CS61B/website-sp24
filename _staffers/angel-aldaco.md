Hello there! I’m a 4th-year majoring in Computer Science and Political Science and minoring in Journalism! You can usually find me wearing bright red beats headphones probably listening to some Bowie or some OSTs. Right now, as I’m writing this I am reading Tomorrow , and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow but I also enjoy watching Better Call Saul, Succession and Ghibli movies. I also really love playing piano and Super Metroid! I hope to be as helpful to you as a data structure is to an algorithm/project! So feel free to reach out (especially if you have any recommendations for books movies tv shows life)!
