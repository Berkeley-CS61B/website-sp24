Hello people : ) My name is Teresa and I am a junior studying Computer Science and Data Science. I am from Chengdu, Beijing, and Palos Verdes(LA), currently getting my daily dose of corgi and motorcycle content, trying to learn German, and reading about the history of western art. This is my fourth time teaching 61B and looking forward to a fun semester with you all!
