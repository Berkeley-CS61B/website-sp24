Hey everybody! I'm a third-year majoring in CS + DS and this is my third time being on course staff for 61B(L)! Outside of 61B, you can find me playing JRPGs, consuming concerning amounts of coffee, or finding more K-Pop and obscure indie rock/emo music for my 1000+ song playlist. Excited to help grow y'all's 61üÖ±Ô∏èrains! :DDD
