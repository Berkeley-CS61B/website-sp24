Hi everybody, my name is Mohammad - this is my first time teaching and I'm really excited to get to know you all! I loved 61B when I was taking it and I hope you do too. In my free time, I watch MMA, play video games, lose at poker, and just enjoy life. Let me know if you have any music recs or just want to talk!
