Hi! I'm Elana, a third year majoring in computer science and French. In addition to being a TA, I am also a CSM senior mentor advisor for 61B. When I'm not teaching data structures and algorithms, I enjoy drawing, learning new languages, and watching anime. I'm super excited to meet you all, and I look forward to a fun semester! Please feel free to reach out about anything :3
