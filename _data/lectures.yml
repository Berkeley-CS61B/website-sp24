# Instructions for updating website #
#####################################

# To upload lecture slides to the website, just put the PDF
# in assets/lectures using the filename convention above.
#
# The link to the slides will automatically appear once you
# put the PDF with the right filename in the right folder.
#
# Lecture slide filepaths are all formatted based on the lecture number.
# Pad lecture numbers, e.g. lecture 2 uses "02", not "2".
#
# For example, the first few lecture slides should be put at:
#   - /assets/lectures/cs188-sp23-lec01.pdf
#   - /assets/lectures/cs188-sp23-lec02.pdf
#     ...
#   - /assets/lectures/cs188-sp23-lec25.pdf

# To link lecture recordings on the website, fill in the
# recordings field in the corresponding lecture below.

# Lecture notes are similarly formatted, and links also
# automatically appear when you put the PDF in the right filename
# in the right folder.
#
# For example, the first few lecture notes should be put at:
#   - /assets/notes/cs188-sp23-note01.pdf
#   - /assets/notes/cs188-sp23-note02.pdf
#     ... 
#   - /assets/notes/cs188-sp23-note25.pdf

# Each element in the array corresponds to one box on the website.
# This includes boxes that are blank or don't have a lecture.
# By default, each box spans 1 row (edit the default in syllabus.yml).
# To override this, use the "rowspan" attribute to resize a box.

# The website automatically numbers each element in the array.
# To skip numbering (e.g. for a "no lecture" box), add
# "nonumber: True" as an attribute.

# To add a box on a date without a lecture, or to add an extra box
# on a date with a lecture, add the date to the extra_days field
# in syllabus.yml (more documentation there). Then, to fill in your
# new box, add an element in the array where the box would appear.
