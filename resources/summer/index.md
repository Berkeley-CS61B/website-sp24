## Enrollment

### Q1: Will the course expand?
We don’t know. (And we still won’t know even if we know your waitlist position, so please don’t email us to ask.)

We will not have any information about potential course expansion until the first full week of the Summer semester (June 17, 2024), at the earliest.

### Q2: What are my chances of getting off the waitlist?
We don’t know. You could check Berkeleytime for enrollment trends from past semesters, but there are no guarantees as to how past trends will extrapolate to Summer 2024.

Besides past trends, we have no way to estimate your odds of getting off the waitlist. If you’re on the waitlist, we strongly recommend having a backup plan in case you are unable to enroll.

### Q3: I’m a concurrent enrollment student. When can I enroll in the class?
The department processes concurrent enrollment applications, not us. Please check this page later for updates; we have no additional information at this time, so please do not email us about concurrent enrollment until this page is updated.

Please don’t email us asking to be added to the class before your application is processed. There won’t be any assignments due until the first batch of applications are processed. If you submit an application after the first batch is processed, see the later questions for getting added to the class (within 48 hours), and the policies for enrolling late.

### Q4: Can I audit the class?
All course materials that we can share with auditors will be posted publicly on the course website. Also, on the policies page, there is a link to a public Gradescope class that you can join.

### Q5: I officially enrolled in the class, or filled out the form requesting to be enrolled, but I don’t have access to Gradescope/Ed.
We sync the rosters once a day, so you may need to wait a bit before being automatically added to the class. If you’ve been officially enrolled for 48 hours and haven’t been added, send an email to cs61bl@berkeley.edu. Please don’t ask us about being added until 48 hours have passed; we don’t have time to manually add each student.

### Q6: How do I enroll late in the class?
It is your responsibility to keep up with the class before you enroll.

If you enroll late, you need to be fully caught up with the class within 3 days of enrolling. If any assignments are due before the date you enroll, you can submit a request through the extensions form (linked on the website) for up to 3 days after you enroll, so that your submission is not counted late.

You can attend lectures and discussion sections before you are officially enrolled. The course website will publicly post any recordings, videos, and resources.

If you’d like early access to the homeworks, you can use the ungraded copy on the auditors Gradescope class (link on the policies page), though you will need to re-fill out the homeworks when you are added to the official Gradescope.

## Exams

### Q7: When are the exams?
TBA

### Q8: Can I take this class remotely? Do you offer remote exams?
TBA

### Q9: Do you offer alternate time exams?
If you are unable to take the exam at the scheduled time, we will be offering only one alternate exam time, in-person only, immediately after the scheduled exam. Specifically, the alternate midterm time is immediately after the scheduled time. The alternate midterm time is TBA. The alternate final exam time is TBA (we’ll give you a few minutes to walk between exams). There are no other alternate exam times. There are no remote exams at alternate times.

We are only offering the alternate exam time if you are unable to take the exam at the normal time. For example, if you have another exam at the same time, you can take the alternate-time exam. However, wanting a break between non-conflicting exams would not be a valid reason to take the alternate-time exam, because in this case you are able to take the exam at the normal time.

We’ll release a form closer to the exams for you to sign up for an alternate-time exam.
